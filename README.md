# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App
I made this step to create an app in `todo` repository:
```
$ npx create-react-app todo
```
Therefore I work in this directory.
To run the project in the development mode use:
```
$ npm start
```

## The application is published at 
> https://yanakryshchuk-ucu.github.io/todo/
