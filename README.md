# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
I made this step to create an app in `todo` repository:
`npx create-react-app todo`
Therefore I work in this directory.
To run the project in the development mode use:
`npm start`
